# MyReads Project

This project is part of my grade on Udacity's React Nanodegree. To see the original Udacity's starter template, please refer to [Udacity's starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)

## Installing and running Instructions

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Known issues

* there is a issue related with the time spent to load the query results. I used `Set`s to optimize the code, but seems I have some issue when I'm resolving the `promisse` to fill the result-grid.
